        1: ["Doctor, finally I realize that I have always suffered from the missing approval from my parents. But you made me open up my eyes. I have my own family now, and a large group of people who really love me for the good person I am. I think I'm ready to let that toxic part of me go. I feel free finally. Thank you doctor",
       "Now everything is clear to me. I have had many problems in my life because of the way I was neglected as a child by my own parents. But I have to stop concentrating on that, you made me realize the wonderful achievements I made in my life. If I think about that, I feel confident and happy. Thanks doctor, I think you solved my problem for good!",
       "I wasted many years of my life hating my parents for their shortcomings. You showed me how stupid that was…because the truth is that they have always been doing the best they could and they always provided what I needed. I feel comfortable enough to get over my toxic behavior towards my parents. I will start to love them and enjoy them for as long as they will be alive. Thanks for having saved the relationship with my parents!",
       "you know what? I think you flipped the right switch in my brain. I now understand how the narcissistic behavior of my father has always conditioned my life. But it won't be like that anymore. I won't search for abusive partners because that's the only language I understand. I am a better person and I love myself now and I will finally break free from what was weighing me down in the past",
       "I have always thought that the break up of my parents was a big trauma for me. This thought always held me down in my life. But you completely changed my point of view. I have been loved not only by my parents, but also by the family of the new partner of my mother. I have had, to be honest, more love than many others have while growing up. I appreciate this now. I won't allow myself to self-pity anymore. I am a better person now and that's thanks to you, doctor",
       "it's unbelievable, I thought I would have never been able to be much of a person, considering that my parents were low-level criminals. But by talking to you I realized how different I am from them and the good things I did in my life. I am not a slave to my roots anymore. I am my own person and I feel much better now. I am cured, finally!"],
        2: ["Doctor, I can see that you tried, but nothing is saving me. I'm a slave to the deviations caused by my parents and that's all I ever be. I have accepted it though…I won't be coming to therapy anymore. I will just live my miserable life from now on",
       "I realize now that I am too old to change. I have grown up in a family where abuse was the norm so this is the only language I understand now. It was stupid of me to try and fight it. This is just what I am and unfortunately, I need to live with the consequences. I won't be coming here anymore, I just need to accept what I am",
       "Yes, the traumas caused by my parents breaking up is clear to me now. But the truth is that I am too weak to fight it. I am simply not able to change the way I am now. I guess I will just keep all my problems and live on. Yes. That's what I'll do from now on. Thanks anyway doctor, goodbye",
       "It's not my fault I am so incapable of developing relationships. My parents never taught me that….well, to be honest, they never taught me anything at all, since they never gave me any attention. But to believe that I can change now, at this stage, it's foolish. I don't believe you, doctor, I can't do anything to change. This is just the way I am and it's ok...really, I accept it. I won't be talking to you anymore. Goodbye",
       "I told everybody this was not going to help me. Come on! Who can really believe that coming here to talk to a, no offense doctor, to an unknown person can change you and undo years upon years of living with an abusive parent? I have nothing against you doctor, but for me, this ends here. My problems are just too big to be solved",
       "Doc, come on…both my parents were alcoholics that found every excuse to beat me up when I was a child. Now you are sitting here telling me that I can become some sort of happy middle-class person with a perfect life. That is just impossible. Sorry, but this ends now, goodbye doctor"]

        1: ["doctor, you opened my eyes. I have been blaming myself for not being able to create a bond with people. But thanks to you I understood that I have always been looking into the wrong group of people. I have to be aware of the kind of person I am and if I want to find friends, I need to look for like-minded people. I am now confident I will have much more fruitful relationships. Thanks and goodbye doctor!",
       "I just realize that the problem with my friendships is not what I thought. I always blame my friends for not understanding me or not being attentive enough. Doctor…I have always only wanted from them, I have never really thought about the fact that I rarely give something to them. I'll work on myself first, before complaining about my friends! Thanks for helping me doctor! Goodbye!",
       "for years I have been expecting the wrong things from my friendships. I expected friends to be some kind of fixer for all of my problems, but you build a relationship when you live together happy moments. I will focus on creating good memories with my friends instead of being angry at them for not solving all of my issues. Things are going to improve so much...thank you for having helped me doctor! Now I can handle it on my own!",
       "Now I see things for what they are. I was so scared of not having enough friends because I could never handle being alone. But you made me realize that if I keep avoiding this fear of mine instead of facing it, I will never feel confident and thus I will never make new friends. I was like a dog biting his own tail, but now I finally broke this vicious cycle. I will be fine now. Goodbye, doctor! ",
       "I realize that in many ways, the friends I have are the mirror of the person I am. I have never really taken responsibility for my own life and now here I am blaming my failures on my friends' shoulders. All I have to do is grow up, take my life into my own hands and make a better person out of myself. Then I will maybe be able to help my friends too. Thanks, doctor for having helped me, I'll be fine now. Goodbye!",
       "doctor, you are definitely right. I have been convincing myself for years that I need to have friends and go out all the time to be happy. But it's foolish to think that I could find happiness outside of myself. I need instead to focus on what are my worries and my anxieties. Once I will be a more well-rounded and strong adult, I will have no problem creating friendships. This therapy helped me a lot, thanks! Goodbye doctor!"],
        2: ["you know what doctor? I think I'm done searching for friendships. I have tried everything that you told me about, but apparently, I lack the basic human ability to interact with people. I will now accept my loneliness, thanks for trying to help me, but there is no helping me. Goodbye",
       "Doctor I concluded that there is nobody to be trusted in this world. You are nice to give me all those pieces of advice, but even if I completely change myself, I will always be hurt by the people I try to create a friendship with. I have accepted this now. It doesn't matter anymore...I'll be alone, no problem. Goodbye doctor!",
       "doctor please stop trying. I know what's my problem, I was born at the wrong age because I simply cannot get along with these new digital technologies. And to be honest I don't want to have anything to do with socials and that other stuff. If this means that I will not be able to create any friendships, then so be it! This is my decision...goodbye doctor!",
       "Doctor I think I'm sick of this. Trust me, I have given everything I had to many people who were supposedly my friends and all I ever got in return was pain and suffering. I don't want to be hurt anymore. I will not try to create a friendship anymore. Thanks for trying doctor but my therapy ends now! Goodbye ",
       "ok now stop doctor. I'm sick of listening to you, a wealthy and respectable professional who has never faced any problem in life that is giving examples of what I should do to make friends...well, You don't have any idea…in the place where I grew up people were fighting each other for a piece of bread.  I have this instinct in me, that I will never trust people, and your advice just makes me sick! I'll never see you again, goodbye!",
       "I think you are saying all the right things, but unfortunately this doesn't apply to me. I'm such a difficult person and I have a strange character. I am convinced that there is nobody in this world that can get along with me. It's a waste of time to keep trying. I'll live my life like I've done till now, alone. I'm fine with it doctor, really. I won't be continuing therapy. Goodbye!"]

    'wr': {
        1: ["Thanks to you, now I know what I have to do. I've spent my entire life waiting for people to acknowledge my value. But this is passive behavior and it won't take me anywhere! From now on, I will push myself out of my comfort zone and I will show how much I'm worth to my colleagues and bosses. Thanks, doctor, you really helped me figure this out!",
       "I figured it out now! I was convinced that I had to endure the bad work environment because I had to show myself I was capable of standing up for myself. But you showed me that there is no glory in suffering for no reason. I will just switch jobs and avoid toxic environments from now on! My life is going to change now! Thanks and goodbye doctor!",
       "Oh my god I finally see things clearly now! I have always thought that the only way I could be accepted by people was to have a respectable job, so the main part of my life has always been working and this caused me so much stress. But you helped me to understand that my family and many people love me for the person I am, independent from my job. I will give less importance to my job from now on. Things are going to be so much better now...thanks doctor for saving me!",
       "I never spoke up to my boss because I feared being fired. But you are right doctor,  I do an awesome job for my company, I am respected by my peers and I am an invaluable asset to my office. I won't be fearing retorsions anymore! From now on, my bosses will have to listen to what I have to say. Now I'm finally ready to leave therapy, goodbye doctor!",
       "Now I understand what's my problem. I am transforming into the same person that my father was. After all, he was never at home, he never really was a part of the family, he was more of a spectator. Work was always the main priority in his life. And I was going down the same path...oh my god, doctor, thank you so much for opening my eyes. All I want from now on is to enjoy the treasure that is my family. Work is not important if I am not living out my life. I'm a better person now, goodbye doctor!",
       "I was so blind…I didn't realize till now that I can't interact with people, in the same way, all the time. At work, obviously, relations are different and often hide ulterior motives. I have suffered so much because I never realized that and invested huge emotional energies in all relationships. You, doctor, showed me the truth. Now I will be on the lookout for red flags in the people at work. I now have the instruments to protect myself. I feel strong now, I can finally manage on my own! Thank you and goodbye doctor!"],
        2: ["oh my god please stop doctor. Stop telling me how professional and smart I am. This doesn't work. I just need to accept that I don't have the guts to make it out in the corporate world. But don't worry, I'm ok with it…I will just mind my own business and survive on the margins of my office. It's not your fault doctor, it's just that I won't change no matter what. Goodbye",
       "You and my family just keep telling me the same thing. I should work less…wow, what a nice piece of information…Like if my dream was to be working all the time. What you don't understand is that if I stop working, my family won't have food on the table. I appreciate the effort doctor, but the truth is that things simply cannot change. So this ends now for me. Goodbye!",
       "everyone keeps telling me that I have to talk to my managers…I'm sick of it doctor! I have spoken many times, it doesn't work. I will start being aggressive, those people will have to listen to me….don't even try to stop me doctor, it's better if you stay out of this. Anyway, you'll never see me again, goodbye",
       "doctor it's too easy for you to say that I should stop thinking about the job when I'm not in the office. To be honest, thinking about the problems I have at work is such a laid-back experience compared to the giant issues I have at home. I don't have any control over my life. So I think the best option for me is to keep myself stressed out with job-related stuff instead of thinking about my partner having sex with my best friend. So goodbye doctor, I don't need your advice anymore",
       "ok ok, now stop it. I figured it out. My parents have been too much positive with me, always telling me I was the best of this and that… But the truth is that I'm not that much smart. I have to accept that at the job, there is always going to be someone better than me. I am the master of mediocrity and I realized that also by talking to you. So that's it doctor, your work is finished, now I know myself and my place in the universe. Goodbye!",
       "You know what doctor, I don't really know why I came here. What was I thinking? That I could turn my entire life around with some small talk? I am a huge failure and I deserve to be treated like shit at work. I will not change and coming here was a huge mistake. Goodbye doctor"]

First, you showed me what a selfish person I have been and then you made me understand that the problems I had with my partner were because of my selfishness itself. Now I will improve my behavior and I'll love my partner even more! Thank you so much for your help doctor! Goodbye!",
       "well doctor, I think you did it! Before coming here I was full of anger toward my partner for being the cause of my discomfort. Now I am aware that the source of it is the things I don't like about myself. And I also see how my partner has always tried to help me with those. I was so stupid and unfair to my love. But not anymore! From now on I will give it all to my relationship. Thanks for this therapy, doctor! Goodbye!",
       "I realize now that I spent all my life thinking that I had to jump from one relationship to the other because it worked nicely for me! I was popular because I always had a partner and I was never bored. But you showed me how much I neglected my inner self and how weak I truly am under this mask of self-confidence. Not anymore doctor! Now my only objective is to develop myself as a person.  Goodbye Doctor!",
       "I wasted so much energy in toxic relations because I thought it was my nature to fall in love with abusive and selfish partners… as if I were some kind of masochist. But you helped me understand that this is not me! I am only being influenced by the traumas I had in my childhood. I can now finally see my real self and I won't let my past ruin my life anymore! Thanks, doctor, I'll be fine now. Goodbye!",
       "I thought my life was perfect because everybody envied me for my success in flirting and dating. I have always had a new partner almost every other day. But then I couldn't sleep at night and I didn't know why. You, doctor, helped me to realize that what I truly long for is a stable, romantic relationship and I was repressing this wish because I was traumatized by the pain my parents caused each other. I was defending myself by never committing for real. But now I'm a different person. I'll be a better person now. Thanks doctor and goodbye!",
       "Doctor, I feel you soo close to me that I'm able to acknowledge my deepest thoughts. I have always lost interest in my partners after a while…I never knew why…or at least, I was pretending now to know why. I remember countless daydreams about dating a person of my same-sex...but as soon as I had them, I forced myself to push them under the rag and forget them. You helped me to decide not to be this repressed person anymore. I want to finally be myself now. Thanks for this breakthrough, doctor! Goodbye"],
        2: ["Doctor..it doesn't matter. The more I love a person, the more that person gets away from me. I should be an asshole like all the others and then partners would be following me like dogs. But I am not able to do it. I am too good of a person and that's why I'll always be alone. Therapy won't change this, so I'm leaving, goodbye doctor",
       "Doctor, trust me, for years everybody has tried to convince me that I can change, that i can stop behaving like a kid and finally create a stable, deep bond with someone. But It's just a fairytale. If I even only think about settling down, I feel like I'm dying. I will not change...I don't want to change. thanks for trying, but I'm done with therapy. Goodbye!",
       "doctor I think I just don't have any energy left in me…I have tried so many times to truly and deeply give all of myself to a partner and in the end, I've always been left alone. I have suffered too much and not even therapy can help me in believing that I can find a person who will love me back. I am not able anymore to invest time and energy into new relationships. That's the hard truth and I have to accept it. Goodbye doctor",
       "ok stop it doctor! You are digging too deep. I have lived all my life as a straight and I know that it's your job to disrupt bad behaviors…but I'm not ready. I'm afraid of what I will find if I turn that stone over. I will keep living my slightly unfulfilling life with my partner but I won't change the status quo. Thanks and goodbye doctor",
       "come on, just stop now! Do you really expect me to believe all that bullshit about self-confidence and stuff? People just look for money and success when choosing a partner, personality doesn't matter! This is the truth and since I'm poor I'll be alone forever. Therapy isn't what I need, I need to win the lottery. Goodbye doctor!",
       "Yes, I understand that I should work on myself to get over my break up. But I feel so sad because I know that the love of my life is gone and I'll never be able to get it back. Even if I become a better person and get over it and find a new partner, I'm sure that I will never feel that intense love ever again. And since this is unfortunately the way things are, it means that I don't need to come to therapy anymore. I just need to accept that the only chance I had a true happiness is gone. Goodbye doctor"]

#Standard messages
opening_message = "Welcome to your office doctor. Your aim is to help your patient to bring out the traumas causing them issues in four aspects of life: family, friends, love and work. The first part of their phrases will give you information on their stress level and trust towards you, in the second part they will talk about the topic. Pay attention and understand if they are happy or not with that particular aspect of their life. Then you will chose the topic and the approach of your reply to improve their perception of that specific topic. You can choose four approaches: aggressive, positive, logic and direct. Therefore, for example, if you notice that your patient is stressed, then maybe you should not choose aggressive approach. You can choose your reply by saying topic and approach to Alexa. For example your reply can be: 'family aggressive', or 'love direct', or 'work positive'. You can say Help, at any time, to listen to the detailed instruction. Would you like to visit your first patient? Say yes to begin a new visit or say help for more instruction"
help_message = "Your job, is to constantly balance, stress, trust and topic score, by switching topic and approach of your reply based on how the patient is feeling. If the scores get to low or too high before the trauma is revealed, you lose him. You save a patient by bringing him to talk very positively about one of the topics.  The topics you can choose are four: family, friends, love and work. The approaches are four: Aggressive, positive, logic and direct. You can mix up topics and approaches. Examples of how you can reply are 'Family aggressive', or 'work logic', or 'love direct', or 'friends positive' or any other combination. At any time during a visit, you can say 'repeat', to listen again to what your patient said and to think about the right approach to use for your reply. "
